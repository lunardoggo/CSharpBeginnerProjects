# Datastructures
Datastructures define a specific format to organize data with that makes storing, using and altering the data easier.  Most of the time you can choose between multiple different data structures to solve a problem, but there are different data structures that excel at different jobs. Binary trees, for example, are great for searching for items, graphs are great for modelling networks and flows, and Sets are well suited for storing items that may only occur once in the collection.

Many data structures are fundamental for certain algorithms, so after looking at these data structures you may want to have a look at the corresponding [algorithms](https://github.com/lunardoggo/CSharpBeginnerProjects/tree/main/Algorithms).

This project showcases some basic data structures that one should know before studying advanced computer science topics. You could theoretically use these implementations in your projcest, but the data structures contained in the standard library are usually more efficient, as this project aims at explaining the basic principles and not how to optimally implement every single operation.
